# On Modelling and Solving Green Collaborative Tactical Transportation Planning
This respository stores data about real intermodal transportation infrastructure between major cities, train stations and ports in the Danube Region. The data has been used to produce the results in our paper "On Modelling and Solving Green Collaborative Tactical Transportation Planning".

## doc
This folder contains some documentation on:
i) how the instances (test data) are generated by the instance generator;
ii) cost and emission tables.

Further details can be found in my [master thesis](http://othes.univie.ac.at/67535/) or in our [publication](https://www.pi.events/IPIC2021/sites/default/files/IPIC2021_DRAFT%20PROCEEDINGS_PAPER_POSTER.pdf) (pages 76-92) at [IPIC2021](https://www.pi.events/).

## data
This folder contains distance- and time-matrices of road, rail and ship transport connections as well as the coordinates of all used locations in the Danube Region.

## instance-generator
Python instance generator for the GTTP, documentation on usage accessable with python igen.py -h (developed for python 3.8 or higher).

The instances generator needs to be given distances, time and location files as for example given in the *data* directory. For other information on the instance generation process, please see [./doc/data.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saper0/gttp-data/main/doc/data.pdf) and the code documentation.

## instances
This folder contains all individual instances (test data) used in "On Modelling and Solving Green Collaborative Tactical Transportation Planning".
